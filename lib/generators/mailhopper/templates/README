Mailhopper has been installed.
===============================================================================

To configure your application to use Mailhopper:

1) Migrate your database with "rake db:migrate".

2) If you want all of your application's email to be queued with Mailhopper, configure mailers either in application.rb or your application's environment-specific configuration files:

  MyApp::Application.configure do
    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :mailhopper
  end

Alternatively, or additionally, configure individual mailers to use Mailhopper:

  class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :mailhopper
  end

3) Install a delivery agent, such as DelayedMailhopper, to deliver emails from your queue.

4) Configure a delivery method in "config/initializers/mailhopper" for your delivery agent to use (the default is smtp).

  Mailhopper::Base.setup do |config|
    config.default_delivery_method = :smtp
  end
